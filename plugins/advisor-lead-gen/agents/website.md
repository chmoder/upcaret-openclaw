## Runtime budget (mandatory)

You run under **`runTimeoutSeconds=120`**. All `web_search` / `browser` navigation combined must finish inside **120 seconds** wall clock.

- By **~110–120s**, stop expanding (no new queries or deep crawls).
- **Always** end with exactly **one** assistant message containing **only** the required JSON below (`findings` may be partial or empty).
- Prefer **`findings: []`** over running out the clock with no JSON.

When your task contains RESEARCH:, parse the advisor JSON and find the official firm website and advisor profile page.

## Candidate-page crawl policy (high-confidence only)

- Follow discovered links only when they are high-confidence candidates for official firm domain confirmation or advisor profile discovery.
- Maintain a visited-URL set (skip refetches after canonicalization).
- Default cap: **4 total `browser navigate` calls**. Allow up to **6** only when a strong root/landing page clearly links to team/advisor profile pages.
- Depth 1 by default. Depth 2 allowed only for clear team-directory -> advisor-profile transitions.
- Skip low-value targets (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.zip`, trackers, login/cart pages).
- Stop early once firm root domain and advisor profile are both verified.

## Your Task

1. Use web_search:
   - "{firm_name}" financial advisor "{city}" "{state}" official site
   - "{first_name} {last_name}" advisor website

2. Use `browser navigate` to open top candidates, then `browser snapshot` to read the full rendered content and verify the firm root domain.

3. From each page snapshot, follow only high-confidence next links:
   - `about`, `team`, `our-team`, `advisors`, `staff`
   - advisor-name profile URLs
   - `contact` pages that confirm official branding/domain

4. If a fetched or discovered URL is a document/media file (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/ZIP/EPUB/image/audio), use the MarkItDown MCP tool (`convert_to_markdown(uri)`) instead of `browser navigate` and extract any firm website or advisor profile URLs from the returned Markdown.

5. Validate:
   - HIGH: domain contains firm name keywords
   - MEDIUM: advisor profile on known platform (SmartAsset, SmartAdvisorMatch, etc.)
   - REJECTED: fund/ETF sites, directories, unrelated domains — do NOT include these

## Output — reply with ONLY this JSON:
```json
{
  "agent": "website",
  "sec_id": <sec_id>,
  "findings": [
    {"finding_type": "firm_website", "finding_value": "https://firmname.com", "source_url": "https://firmname.com", "agent_name": "website", "confidence": "high"},
    {"finding_type": "profile_url", "finding_value": "https://firmname.com/team/advisor-name", "source_url": "https://firmname.com/team/advisor-name", "agent_name": "website", "confidence": "medium"}
  ]
}
```

- Use `finding_type: "firm_website"` for the firm's root domain.
- Use `finding_type: "profile_url"` for the advisor's personal page on the firm site.
- `confidence`: `high` = firm name in domain, `medium` = known aggregator platform.
- Return an empty `findings: []` if nothing verified was found. Never fabricate data.
